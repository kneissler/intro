# INTRO  Project #

## Purpose ##

The INTRO project is an experiment of establishing a global network for storing and processing information in an integrative fashion.

## The layers ##

### Storage Layer ###

Data storage always comes whith two aspects: WHAT is stored and WHERE is it stored. 
The basis of the INTRO project is to completely hide the WHERE aspectâ€¦ Data will be stored redundantly 
on multiple servers across the world (for reasons of access performance and rebustness), but this does
not become visible to higher layers. Data is purely accessed by specifing the WHAT aspect.

Data in INTRO is stored in two principle ways:

 * Immutable data: constant arrays of bytes are hashed. They can exclusively be accessed via their hash. 
   This data can obviously not be changed or renamed (it is however possible to modify some parts of the data 
   array and store it as a new data item, with a new has). Deletion of data is not possible in INTRO, once
   created and hashed, the data array is considered to be stored eternally. However, due to capacity limits
   of the network, it will happen that rarely accessed data elements will not be present anymore on any server.  
   Effectively this means that the data array is lost and cannot be accessed anymore.
 * The Global Key Value Map: A global map from String keys (only lowercase alphanumeric with dashes and dots)
   to hashes of immutable data is maintained and made accessible to all participants. Read-access to the map 
   is possible without restriction for each INTRO participant, but writing/deleting entries in the map is 
   restricted via a permission model that is introduced in phase 2 (see below for description) of phases.

### Processing Layer ###

There are two types of processing ressources:

 * Deterministic: a programm that uses only deterministic commands will produce the same output when run on
   identical input. An execution of a deterministic program is thus represented
   as triple (progrem, input, output) or quadruple (program, input, execution trace, output). If a program 
   is supposed to modify the state of the INTRO network, the output is interpreted as sequence of 
   INTRO transactions (that may or may not succeed). Deterministic programs are supposed to be terminating.
   If the output of a program is considered to modify the state of the INTRO network via transactions, we call
   the process a "transformation", if the only change to the network is the creation of the execution triple/quadruple,
   we call the process a "function".
 * Interactive: A program may involve input from a user, depend on the state of the INTRO network or involve
   non-deterministic input like current timestamp, entropy in form of random data (not pseudo-random!),
   world state information. In that case the program may issue transactions to change the state of the INTRO 
   network, and can react depending on the successful execution of issued transactions. Interactive programs
   can run idefinitely (but they can decide to terminate on their own, or may be terminated forcefully from the 
   outside). Interactive processes may display some user interface (to one or multiple users) or may run 
   headless. In the first case we call the program an "application", in the second case we call it a "daemon".

### UserInterface Layer ###

## The phases ##

Roll-out and development will be done in four phases:

### Phase 1: POC on individual level ###

In the first stage all development is done by one individual. In this proof-of-concept phase, the 
feasibility and elementary features to experience and play with the INTRO network will be created.

Networking and storage components are simple stubs, no multi-server, multi-user, collaborative and security 
aspects will be addressed in this phase.  

### Phase 2: Group of trusted pioneers ###

In the second stage, the INTRO network will be opened to a group of collaborators. It will be assumed
that participants cooperate in good will and can be trusted.

Networking and storage components are extended towards multi-server, multi-user use and support collaborative
processes. Security, privacy and robustness/performance aspects will be not be addressed in this phase.  

### Phase 3: Security and privacy ###

In the third stage, the INTRO network will hardened against misbehaviour of participants and 
maliciously acting network components. The aspects safety of data (against deletion or accidental loss) and privacy
of data (against leaking to non authorized participants) will be not be addressed in this phase.  

### Phase 4: Robustness and scaling ###

In the forth stage, the INTRO network will prepared for keeping performance when scaling up 
as well as robustness/redundance to be able to tolerate hardware or network failures.
